# Description

A fork of [javax.vecmath](https://github.com/kenjihiranabe/javax.vecmath) that was cleaned up and made compatible with Java 9 modules.

## List of changes made to the original library

- Created a `module-info.java` file
- Made the methods `equals`, `toString`, `hashCode` and `epsilonEquals` final
- Made all classes final
- Cleaned the code a bit (someone clearly didn't know what a tabulator was)
- The unit tests were ported to JUnit
